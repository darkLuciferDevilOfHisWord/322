9. State true or false:
Statement: For every removed state, there is a regular expression produced.
a) true
b) false
Answer: a
Explanation: For every state which is eliminated, a new regular expression is produced. The newly generated
regular expression act as an input for a state which is next to removed state.
Answer: a
Explanation: Using different sequence of removal of state, we can have different possible solution of regular
expressions. For n-state deterministic finite automata excluding starting and final states, n! Removal
sequences are there. It is very tough to try all the possible removal sequences for smaller expressions.

Explanation: Complexity theories models randomized algorithms as probalistic turing machines. A
probalistic turing machine is a non deterministic turing machine which randomly chooses between the
available transitions at each point according to some probalistic distribution.
8. For the given algorithm, find the probability of finding after k iterations:
find_a(array A, n, k) 
begin 
   i=0 
     repeat 
           Randomly select one element out of n elements 
           i=i+1 
     until i=k or a is found 
end
a) (1/2)
k
b) (1-(1/3))
k
c) 1-(1/2)k
d) None of the mentioned
Answer: c
Explanation: The given is known as Monte Carlo Algorithm. If a is fount, the algorithm succeeds, else the
algorith fails. The algorithm doesn not guarantee success but the run time is bounded.
9. Which of the following can be solved in computer science?
a) P=BPP problem
b) NP=co-NP problem
c) Do one way problems exist?
d) All of the mentioned
Answer: d
Explanation: There exists a list of unsolved problems in computational theory which includes many
problems including the ones given.
Answer: d
Explanation: Freivalds algorithm is a probabalistic randomized algorithm we use to verify matrix
multiplication. On the other hand, Randomness can be useful in quicksort. If the algorithm selects pivot
element uniformaly at random, it has a probably high probabilty of finishing the work in O(nlogn) time
regardless of the input.

12. Dot operator in regular expression resembles which of the following?
a) Expressions are juxtaposed
b) Expressions are multiplied
c) Cross operation
d) None of the mentioned
Answer: a
Explanation: Dot operation or concatenation operation means that the two expressions are juxtaposed i.e.
there are no intervening operators in between. In fact, UNIX regular expressions use the dot for an entirely
different purpose: representing any ASCII character.
13. Which among the following is not an associative operation?
a) Union
b) Concatenation
c) Dot
d) None of the mentioned
Answer: d
Explanation: It does not matter in which order we group the expression with the operators as they are
associative. If one gets a chance to group the expression, one should group them from left for convenience.
For instance, 012 is grouped as (01)2.
Answer: c
Explanation: Using the rules of precedence on the give expression, c is the appropriate choice with the order
of: Bracket>Kleene>Dot>Union

9. State true or false:
Statement: For every removed state, there is a regular expression produced.
a) true
b) false
Answer: a
Explanation: For every state which is eliminated, a new regular expression is produced. The newly generated
regular expression act as an input for a state which is next to removed state.
Answer: a
Explanation: Using different sequence of removal of state, we can have different possible solution of regular
expressions. For n-state deterministic finite automata excluding starting and final states, n! Removal
sequences are there. It is very tough to try all the possible removal sequences for smaller expressions.
